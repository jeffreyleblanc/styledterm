# To Do

* [x] Add example to show `tprint` functionality
* [ ] FIXME: Waiting for `del` to print seems to print out of order
* [ ] Clean up and document the indentation methods
* [ ] Document the centering methods
* [ ] Document the lower level methods
* [ ] For annotated text, support `[red bold]` in addition to `[red][bold]`
* [ ] For `p`, support `[red][bold]` in addition to `[red bold]`
